Bhargavi,

I could not find the .pdf document corresponding to your midterm exam.

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 200 wasn't enough? -1pt
There is no report of E_out. -10pts

2) It seems like the code works only for initially small values of N. What if I
over-estimate N and start with N=1,000,000? Your code would not work. -1pt
Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) Good picture/drawing. +5pts


Peace,
