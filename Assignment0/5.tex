 Relationship between Bernoulli and binomial distribution
 
 A Bernoulli irregular variable has two conceivable results: 0 or 1 . A binomial conveyance is the aggregate of free and indistinguishably appropriated Bernoulli irregular variables. So for instance, say I have a coin, and when hurled, the likelihood it lands heads is p. So the likelihood that it lands tails is $1âˆ’p$ (there are no other conceivable results for the coin hurl). On the off chance that the coin lands heads, you win one dollar. On the off chance that the coin lands tails, you don't win anything. 

For a solitary coin hurl, the likelihood you win one dollar is p. The arbitrary variable that speaks to your rewards after one coin hurl is a Bernoulli irregular variable.
